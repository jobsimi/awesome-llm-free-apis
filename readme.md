## Terminology

| Token       | The text generation model processes text in Token-based units. Token represents a common sequence of characters. For example, a single Chinese character“Kui” might be decomposed into a combination of tokens, while a short and common phrase like“China” might use a single Token. Roughly speaking, one Token is equivalent to about 1.5-2 Chinese characters for a typical Chinese text. |
